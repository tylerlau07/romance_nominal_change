The Blackwell History of the Latin Language

'Old' Latin and its Varieties c. 400-150BC
- Monophthongization (94):
1)	/au/ and /ai/ persist in Roman Latin, but /ai̞/ > more open articulation (bc of change of spelling to ae after 187BC, ai gone by 120BC)
	/au/ and /ai/ > /ɔ:/ and /ɛ:/ quite early in some non-urban dialects (perhaps under influence of Umbrian Italic languages)
	Monophthongization later general in later vulgar Latin of imperial period--Augustus 27BC after collapse of Roman Republic
	Evidence of many Romance varieties shows it was never completed for /au/
	In non-final syllables, /ai/ > /ei/ by weakening

2)	/oi/ > /u:/ in initial syllables (oinos > unus = one)
	poena 'penalty' besides punire 'punish' and cf. French peine vs. punir confirm that surviving examples of /oi/ > /ɛ/ in vulgar Latin
	Elsewhere, /oi/ > /ei/ by weakening, then same development as for original /ei/ (> i)

3)	Both original and weakened /ei/ > close /e̝:/ during third century and then raised > /i:/ in Roman Latin by  midmdle of second century (intermediate stage in many non-urban varieties)
	Close mid-vowel from monphthongization must have been distinct from original /e:/ in Roman Latin (latter does not raise to /i:/
	/eu/ merged with /ou/ at early date and then /ou/ > close /o̝:/ > /u:/, probably by end of 3rd century
	Dialectically arrested at intermediate stage

Consonants (96)
- Final /s/ weakly articulated in Old Latin, at least preconsonantally after a short vowel—sometimes not written in Roman inscriptions of 3rd century and regional Latin documents more generally (also failed to make position pre-consonantally in poetry pre-200BC)
- Quickly restored graphically and also phonetically in elite Roman Latin, may also have had some limited impact in certain popular varieties (Fr. fils < filius)
- Final -m regularly omitted in early inscriptions and well known that final vowel + /m/ regularly elided prevocalically in classical poetry
	—> possibly led to nasalization and concomitant lengthening of preceding vowel

Dialectal Varieties: Praenestine (126)
- Many innovatory features “rustic” but impact continued to later—doubles such as faenus/fenus ‘interest, profit’, saepes/sepes ‘hedge, fence’, lautus/lotus ‘clean, sumptuous’, etc.
- Urbanization process culminated in second and first centuries

Bilingualism (232)
- Switch between Gaulish (written in Greek script) to Latin from beginning of 1st century AD, Gaulish continued to be spoken alongside Latin

Gaius Nouius Eunus and changes in the phonology of Latin (238)

- September 15, 39AD—Eunus, Murecine near Pompeii after eruption of Vesuvius
	- Prone to omit nasals, both at word end and internally before following stop
	- Consistent in writing -ae as -e (ɛ)
	- Some features observed in non-standard registers but not here—stigmatized as speech of underclass:
		- Omission of final -s after rounded back vowel common in early Republican inscriptions, in Plautus and other Early Latin poets before Catullus, but only omitted in two words (de for dies and nummo for nummos). Cicero (Orator 161) comments that dropping of final -s once was acceptable in refined Latin but now rural
		- Dropping of aspirate h- from beginning of words and overcompensation of inserting where it was not present
		- Monophthongization of au to o in some Early Latin inscriptions from outside Rome (urban poor within Rome 1st century BC and on)
	- Perhaps first two were not stigmatized as speech of underclass
- Claudius Terentianus—ilingual with Greek (shortly after 100AD) (249)
	- ī > /i/, /i, ē/ > /e/, /e, ae/ > /ɛ/
	- Final -m loss leads to equivalence of 1st declension cases in singular
	- Erodes distinction between accusative and ablative, but keeps nominative apart
- Iasucthan (256) ~200AD
	- Ablative case seems to have been in retreat in spoken language, but Iasucthan uses ablative often

Latin in Late Antiquity and Beyond (265)
- Roughly 3rd century AD to end of first millennium
- “francisca” frankish could mean French, first mention of it 999 Pope Gregory V epitaph on tomb
- Continuum between spoken and written languages seems to have lasted longer in Italy than in France—150 years after Gregory v epiatph, gap between speech adn written Latin in northern France too wide to bridge
	- French Strasbourg oaths 842—first conscious attempt to write down spoke register distinct from Latin
- Latin at end of 1st millennium is “living fossil”
- Proto-Romance—speakers in whole area able to communicaet with each otherr
	- 953, John, later Abbot of Gorze (near Metz in northeastern France), acted as envoy for German King Otto I to court of Abd al-Rahman III, caliph of Cordoba in southern Spain. Life of John records that he had no difficulty in conversing with Christians from Cordoba (perhaps modify regional differences to communicate), standard also still influenced spoken language

From Latin to Romance (272)
- Developments that took place to a greater or lesser degree across whole speech area in period 
- Phonology (272)
	- Classical Latin—distinguished by feature of length, prosodic accent was one of stress
	- Combination of vowel length and stress accent typologically uncommon, prone to replacement
	- Loss of length as distinctive feature, accented vowels came to be pronounced long, unaccented short
	
			ī > i				ū > u
			ē, i > e			ō, u > o
			e > ɛ				o > ɔ
					a > a

	ae > ɛ
	au in most of Romance area until latter half of first millennium

	/i/, /e/ > /j/ before /o, u, a/ (-ia for -ea, -iolus for -eolus)
	Combinations of like vowels prone to contraction (tuus > tus ‘your’)

	Sporadic lowering of vowels before following /-r/, sometimes motivated by low vowel earlier in word —> ansar < anser ‘goose’, passar < passer ‘sparrow’
	Syncope of short vowels in syllables immediately before or after accented syllable (calidus > caldus, frigidus > frigdus)

	Final consonants generally lost except final -s (retained in Iberian Romance and Gaul)
	Loss of final -s in Italy as far back as 3rd century BC
	Nonhomorganic clusters —> assimilation
		—> /ks/ > /ss/ or /s/
		—> /gd/ to /dd/

- Nominal Case Morphology (276)
	- Only Romanian preserves nom/acc and gen/dat in feminine nouns—Romanian from Latin varieties spoken in Pannonia (modern Bosnia and Serbia) and Moesia (modern Bulgaria)
	- Early merger of nom and acc from third century (Pannonia)-could be -as for FNOMPL from levelling of -ae and -as on analogy of 3rd declension -es and -es
	- Rest of Romance, Old French and Old Pronvençal only ones to mark subject case (nom) against oblique
	- Banniard (1992; 518) successive stages: reckons stage III only reached in mid-8th century (but likely speakers lost command of ablative earlier)—argues that ablative eventually syncretized w/ genitive and dative rather than earlier with accusative (some ablative forms used w/ instrumental function in late post-classical texts)
	- Evidence for confusion between genitive and dative in 5th and 6th centuries—rise of prepositional phrases

Stage I			Stage II		Stage III		Stage IV
Classical Latin	

Nom			Nom			Nom			Subject
Gen
		>	Syncretic
Dat					>	Syncretic
Abl			Abl					>	Oblique
Acc			Acc			Acc

- Nominal Gender (278)
	- 4th > 2nd (share -us and -um)
	- Polysyllabic 5th > 1st
	- All nouns in 2nd declension only masculine started w/ speech of some individuals in high Empire—one character in Pretronius’ novel Satyricon uses uinus and balneus for neuters uinum and balneum, Claudius Terentianus has pretius in place of pretium
