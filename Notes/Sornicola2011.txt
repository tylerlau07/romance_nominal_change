Sornicola, Rosanna (Reflections on Synchrony and Diachrony)

* Aspects of distribution of -s and nature of nom and acc forms (19)
	- -s characterizes all ACCPL
	- -s characterizes both NOMPL and ACCPL in Dec III
	- -s characterizes NOMSG in II (and much of III)
	- Many III nouns show formal distinction between NOMSG and rest of paradigm--fewer syllables in NOMSG (imparisyllabicity) and sometimes difference of stress
	- I mostly F, II mostly M, III has both without distinction of gender
	- -m, marker of ACCSG, early subject to deletion -- formal identity btwn NOMSG and ACCSG in I
* Two opposing theories on principles of linguistic change (20)
	- First, asserted and defended by Diez and Meyer-LÃ¼bke; characterized by telelogicity--forces in play leading toward emergence of single universal case, the accusative
