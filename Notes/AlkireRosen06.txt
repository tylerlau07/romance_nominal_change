Romance Languages: A Historical Intro

Extremes of vowel triangle (12)
- ī > i in It, Sp, Fr
- ū > u in It. Sp.
	In French, > y
- a > a in It. Sp.
	In French, > a in blocked syllable (grande > grand)
		   > e in open syllable (clave > clef)

Development of vowels (13)
- The high mid vowels (13)
	Italian and Spanish show no change for high mid 
		i, ē > e > e
		u, ō > o > o
	French depends on if syllable is closed or open
		If closed, blocks change (littera, tērnu, cavērna > lettre, terne, caverne)
		/o/ > /u/ in closed syllables (currit, cōrte > court, cour)
		Free syllables
			e > ej > oj > oɛ > wɛ > wa
			o > ow > ew > ø
- The low mid vowels (15)
		ɛ				ɔ
	Blocked: Sp. > je			Sp. > we
  		 It., Fr. > ɛ 			It., Fr. > ɔ
	Free: 	Sp, It. > je			Sp. > we
		Fr. > jɛ			It. > wɔ
						Fr. > wɔ > wɛ > ø

Diphthongs from Indo-European (23)
- Ones surviving in Latin are /aw/ (AU) /aj/ (AE) /oj/ (OE)
	/oj/ > /ū/ by Classical Latin, remaining instances become /e/
	/aw/ > /ɔ/ AFTER /ɔ/ had produced primary diphthong
	/aj/ > /ɛ/ generally, but sometimes /e/ (saeta 'silk', praeda 'prey')

/b/ and /w/ merge intervocalically to /β/ (33)

Loss of word final -m amply documented from 298 BCE on (36)

Declension IV > II, except for humans (nurus, socrus) and manus (hand) (186)
Declension V > I, some become III (fidēs, rem)

Loss of oblique cases (187)
- Instead of genitive, DE + noun as early as 2nd century BCE 
- Dative begins to be replaced with AD + noun also 2nd century BCE
- Popular Latin prefers ablative to accusative, "wrong" accusatives become typical (Hermann 2000: 53)

The Popular Latin Two-Case System (188)

		1		2		3
sg.	Nom	capra		mūrus		panis
	Non-Nom	capra		mūru		pane
pl.	Nom	caprae/capras	mūri		panes
	Non-Nom	capras		mūros		panes	

First dec already caseless, -as spread to subjects early (late antiquity--300AD on?)
Italian, Spanish first attested from 900--no case already
French attested from 800s, two-case system, crumbles by 1200s

Italian --> for 1 and 3, neutralized by changes; for 2, mūros > muroi > muro leads to neutralization with singular, so nominative is preferred (189)
Spanish collapses in favor of accusative
French --> 3rd declension goes to 2nd or 1st, according to gender

	sg	Nom	chevre	murs	pains		
		Non-Nom	chevre	mur	pain
	pl	Nom	chevres	mur	pain
		Non-nom	chevres	murs	pains

Minor noun declensions in Old French
	
	sg	Nom	fins	livre
		Non-Nom	fin	livre
	pl	Nom	fins	livre
		Non-Nom	fins	livres

- fins type develops like other feminines (chevre), but retains nom.sg -s of Latin Dec III (finis)
- livre type develops like other masculines (murs, pains) but no nom.sg. -s (just as in Latin liber)
- cas régime, unlike cas sujet regular (-s always in plural), so it replaces by 1200s and goes way of Spanish

Romanian (252)
- ɛ > e (jɛ > je)

Emergence of the Romance Vernaculars (317)
- Mid 700s, Western Europe materializing as cultural zone
- Mediterranean unity broken by dissolution of Western Roman Empire and with Arab conquest of North Africa and, starting in 711, most of Spain
- Former Gaul, illiterachy norm, new Frankish dynasty Carolingians
- Charlemagne (768-814)'s court scholars deplored low standards of accuracy in Latin, worried that important writings might be so corrupted as to be unintelligible
- Charlemagne 787: ordinary people could no longer understand spoken Latin
